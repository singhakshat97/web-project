		<td > <h4 > BENEFITS OF BLOOD DONATION</h4>
		<b>Hemochromatosis </b> <br>

Health benefits of blood donation include reduced risk of hemochromatosis.
 Hemochromatosis is a health condition that arises due to excess absorption of iron by the body. <br>
 
 <b> Anti-cancer benefits </b> <br>
 Blood donation may also help in lowering risk of cancer.
  By donating blood the iron stores in the body are maintained at 
  healthy levels. And the reduction in iron levels in the body is linked with low cancer risk.<br>
  
<b>Healthy heart and liver </b> <br>

Blood donation is beneficial in reducing risk of heart and liver ailments caused by iron overload in the body. 
Intake of iron rich diet may increase the iron levels in the body and since only limited 
proportions can be absorbed excess iron gets stored in heart, liver and pancreas. <br>

<b>Weight loss </b> <br>

Regular blood donation reduces the weight of the donors.
 This is helpful to those who are obese and are at higher risk of cardiovascular diseases
  and other health disorders. However, the blood donation should not be very frequent and you may 
  consult your doctor before donating blood to avoid any health issues. <br>

<b>New blood cells</b> <br>

After donating blood, the body works to replenish the blood loss. This stimulates the production of new blood cells and in turn helps in maintaining good health.

		<td><h4> IMPORTANCE OF BLOOD DONATION</h4> <b>For you, it's just a few moments out of your day but for patients in need, it may save their life.</b> <br>

Specialist medical staff are on hand at all times during the donation, 
which is a simple, safe and painless procedure. There is no risk for donors 
of giving blood, and it may help patients recover more quickly. <br>

<b>Donations </b> <br>
 

Despite medical and technological advances, blood cannot currently be made.
 The only way of getting hold of it is via blood donations from people who give blood. <br>

<b>Each donation may help up to three different people </b> <br>

Because each blood donation provides three different blood components, each with its own role in treating patients,
 it helps up to three different people.<br>

<b>Blood and its components have a limited life </b> <br>

Red blood cell concentrates can be kept for 42 days <br>
Plasma can be stored for a year <br>
Platelets can be kept for five days <br></td>

		<td><h4> HOW BLOOD DONATION WORKS</h4> <p>Donating a unit of blood takes about 45 to 60 minutes. Medical equipment is sterile, used only once, and then discarded.<br>
		 The actual donation process works like this: </p>
<p>1) You will complete donor registration, which includes your name, address, 
phone number, donor identification number (if you have one), and other related information.<br>
2) You will be asked to show your donor card or other identification.<br>
3) You will be asked some questions about your health, travel history, and lifestyle or risk behaviors. 
All information is confidential.<br>
4) You will receive a mini “health exam”, including checks for blood pressure,
 temperature, and pulse. In addition, a drop of blood will be obtained from your
  finger to make sure that you have enough red blood cells to safely donate.<br>
5) You will proceed to a donor bed where your arm will be cleaned with antiseptic. 
If you are allergic to iodine, be sure to tell the phlebotomist so an alternate antiseptic may be used.
6) You will have a blood unit and blood specimens drawn.<br>
