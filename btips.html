  tested for venereal diseases, hepatitis B & C and AIDS. You have to be healthy to give 'safe blood' <br>

		<td id="ten"><h4> TIPS BEFORE THE DONATION </h4>
		<li>Maintain a healthy iron level in your diet by eating iron rich foods, such as red meat, fish, poultry, beans, spinach, iron-fortified cereals and raisins.
Get a good night's sleep.
Drink an extra 16 oz. of water or nonalcoholic fluids before the donation.
Eat a healthy meal before your donation. Avoid fatty foods, such as hamburgers, fries or ice cream before donating. (Fatty foods can affect the tests we do on your blood. If there is too much fat in your blood, your donation cannot be tested for infectious diseases and the blood will not be used for transfusion.)
If you are a platelet donor, remember that your system must be free of aspirin for two days prior to donation.
Remember to bring your donor card, driver's license or two other forms of ID. </li></td>

		<td id="ten"><h4> HOW OFTEN CAN YOU DONATE</h4>
		<li>
		
		It takes eight weeks for the red cells in your blood to replenish themselves after donating blood,
		 you have to wait at least that long between donations. If you’re donating plasma, on the other hand 
		 (which is collected through a machine that separates your blood components to take only the plasma and 
		 then returns the red blood cells to you), then you can donate more often.

While we’re on the topic — there’s another important blood-related substance you can donate — bone marrow. 
Thousands of blood cancer patients rely on a transfusion of bone marrow from a genetic match. You can easily
 join the bone marrow registry by swabbing the inside of your cheek with a kit you get online or at a donor drive.
		
		</li>
		
		
		</td>
		<td id="ten"><h4>TIPS AFTER THE DONAION</h4>
		<li>
		Drink an extra four (8 ounce) glasses of liquids and avoid alcohol over the next 24 hours.
Remove the wrap bandage (if you had one put on your arm) within the next hour.
Keep the strip bandage on for the next several hours.
To avoid a skin rash, clean the area around the strip bandage with soap and water.
Do not do any heavy lifting or vigorous exercise for the rest of the day.
If the needle site starts to bleed, apply pressure to it and raise your arm straight up for about 5-10 minutes or until bleeding stops.
If you experience dizziness or lightheadedness after donation, stop what you are doing and sit down or lie down until you feel better. Avoid performing any activity where fainting may lead to injury for at least 24 hours.
Call us at 1-866-236-3276 to report any additional health information that you forgot to tell us, if you have any problems or if you needed medical care after giving blood.

Relax, listen to music, talk to other donors or read during the donation process.
Take the time to enjoy a snack and a drink in the refreshments area immediately after donating.
